[[using]]
== Using {project}

[[using-installing-versions]]
=== Installing versions

Use the `{script} add` command to install the given versions of Minishift.
You may supply multiple versions as arguments to the `{script} add` command.

[NOTE]
====
* The `add` command includes access to the `latest` version string.
Using the `latest` version string will automatically download and install the most recent release of Minishift.
* This is the only command that includes the `latest` version string.
====

Example:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ {script} add latest 1.25.0 1.13.0
----

[NOTE]
====
The `{script} add` command is also aliased as `{script} install`.
====

[[using-setting-active-version]]
=== Setting the active version

The active Minishift version used by {project} may be set with the `{script} use` command.
The `{script} use` command expects to be given the desired version string as an argument.

Example:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ {script} use 1.26.1
----

You may clear the active version by using the `{script} use` command without arguments.

Example:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ {script} use
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The `{script} use` command does not manage Minishift profiles.
Use the `minishift profile set` command to ensure that there are no conflicts between profiles and Minishift versions.
Including the version number in the profile name is recommended.
+
Example:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
$ {script} use 1.26.1
$ minishift profile set minishift-1-26-1
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The `{script} use` command is also aliased as `{script} set`.
====

[[using-displaying-active-version]]
=== Displaying the active version

Use the `{script} which` command to display which version is currently active.

Example:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ {script} which
1.26.1
----

[NOTE]
====
The `{script} which` command is also aliased as `{script} active` and `{script} current`.
====

[[using-listing-installed-versions]]
=== Listing installed versions

Use the `{script} ls` command to list the currently installed Minishift versions managed by {project}.
The currently active version is displayed as "`(active)`".

Example:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ {script} ls
1.13.0
1.25.0
1.26.1 (active)
----

[NOTE]
====
The `{script} ls` command is also aliased as `{script} list` and `{script} versions`.
====

[[using-removing-installed-versions]]
=== Removing installed versions

Minishift versions managed by {project} can be removed with the `{script} rm` command.
You may supply multiple versions as arguments to the `{script} rm` command.

Example:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ {script} rm 1.13.0 1.25.0
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Removing the currently active version will remove the active version setting.
You will need to run the `{script} use` command to set a new active version.
* Removing a Minishift version does not remove the profiles or virtual machines associated with that Minishift version.
Ensure that you have removed these artifacts via Minishift before running the `{script} rm` command.
+
Example:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
$ {script} which
1.26.1
$ for profile in $(minishift profile list | awk '{ print $2 }') ; do
  minishift profile delete "$profile"
done
$ {script} rm 1.26.1
----
